Advent of Code 2019

These programs are written in VO Visual Objects Script code with the enhancements of INFOMINDS AG. 
Probably you won't find any compiler/interpreter on the world apart of our's. 
But this is not important for me. More important is, that I can solve many different tasks using this language, 
that is used as a macro programming language in our programs.
